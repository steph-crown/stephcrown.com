              I haven't been the friend you deserve. Over these past months, I've been distant when you needed me closest. I wasn't there for you in
              the ways that matter.

              What hurts most is that you had to start that conversation with "let me respond as a friend." Like you already knew how it would go.
              Like you couldn't count on me to show up the way I should have.

              You had every reason to feel let down. I was thoughtless. I wasn't there with empathy or patience. I made things worse when they needed
              to get better.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <p>
              Looking back at how I responded to you, it was stupid. There's no softer way to put it. It was the wrong move, and I'm not going to sit
              here and defend it or make excuses. That's not what you need from me.

            <p>
              I see how much less of a friend I've been. I see that you shouldn't have felt like you needed to explain yourself or tiptoe around me. I
              see that you're wonderful, and you deserved someone who was actually in your corner.

            <p>
              Instead, I let you down. And then I responded in a way that made you feel like your feelings didn't matter. That's on me. That's all on
              me.

              I can't undo any of that. But I can tell you that I'm aware of it now. Really aware. Not in a defensive way. Just clear-eyed about how I
              failed you.

              I'm not asking you to just move past this. I'm asking for the chance to show you that things can be different. Starting now, and
              especially heading into this new year.
            </p>
          </div>

              I want to be the friend who actually listens. Who shows up. Who thinks about how you're doing and follows through. Who doesn't disappear
              when things get hard or complicated.
            </p>

          <div class="section">
            <p>You deserve that kind of friendship. And you've been that kind of friend to me. I took it for granted, and I know that now.</p>

              I know things feel broken right now. I know you're not interested in talking to me, and honestly, I understand why. I haven't earned
              that trust back yet.

              But I'm going to do better. Not because I'm trying to smooth things over quickly. Not because I want to feel less guilty. But because
              you matter that much to me, and you deserve a friend who shows that.
